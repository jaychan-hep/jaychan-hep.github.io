I'm a physicist and Machine Learning Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL), specializing in developing ML&AI applications and tools for particle physics.

I recently completed my PhD in Physics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2023. During my doctoral studies, I focused on experimental high energy physics and contributed to the ATLAS experiment at CERN. My thesis, titled "Investigation of Higgs Boson Decaying to Di-muon, Dark Matter Produced in Association with a Higgs Boson Decaying to b-quarks and Unbinned Profiled Unfolding," explored fascinating aspects of particle physics.

Outside of academia, I enjoy hiking, skiing, and playing the piano and drums.
