I'm a physicist & Machine Learning Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL) developing ML&AI applications and tools for particle physics.

Prior to joining LBNL, I obtained my PhD in Physics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2023. During my PhD, I studied experimental high energy physics and contributed to the ATLAS experiment at CERN, with a thesis titled “Investigation of Higgs Boson Decaying to Di-muon, Dark Matter Produced in Association with a Higgs Boson Decaying to b-quarks and Unbinned Profiled Unfolding”.

Outside academic, I enjoy hiking, skiing, playing piano and drums.
