I am an coauthor of 184 papers of which 174 are published in peer reviewed journals as a member of the ATLAS Collaborations. The full list can be found at:
<a href='https://inspirehep.net/authors/1605504'>https://inspirehep.net/authors/1605504</a>. Below highlights only the publications which I have made key contributions. In experimental high energy physics it is conventional to list all authors alphabetically regardless of specific contribution.
