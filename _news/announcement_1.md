Today, I successfully defended my thesis with the title "Investigation of Higgs Boson Decaying to Di-muon, Dark Matter Produced in Association with a Higgs Boson Decaying to b-quarks and Unbinned Profiled Unfolding". I am extremely grateful for my advisor Prof. Sau Lan Wu, my thesis defense committee Prof. Kevin Black, Prof. Tulika Bose and Prof. Snezana Stanimirovic, and everyone who attended the defense and supported me. I would also like to thank Dr. Maurice Garcia-Sciveres and Dr. Benjamin Nachman for providing me wonderful research opportunities and connected me to the Berkeley Lab.

I am very excited about my next journey after obtaining my PhD degree --- I will continue my contribution to the ML&AI developments for particle physics as a Machine Learning Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Berkeley Lab!
