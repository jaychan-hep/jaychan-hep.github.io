    abstract = "Hadronization is a critical step in the simulation of high-energy particle and nuclear physics experiments. As there is no first principles understanding of this process, physically-inspired hadronization models have a large number of parameters that are fit to data. Deep generative models are a natural replacement for classical techniques, since they are more flexible and may be able to improve the overall precision. Proof of principle studies have shown how to use neural networks to emulate specific hadronization when trained using the inputs and outputs of classical methods. However, these approaches will not work with data, where we do not have a matching between observed hadrons and partons. In this paper, we develop a protocol for fitting a deep generative hadronization model in a realistic setting, where we only have access to a set of hadrons in data. Our approach uses a variation of a Generative Adversarial Network with a permutation invariant discriminator. We find that this setup is able to match the hadronization model in Herwig with multiple sets of parameters. This work represents a significant step forward in a longer term program to develop, train, and integrate machine learning-based hadronization models into parton shower Monte Carlo programs.",

    abstract = "Unfolding is an important procedure in particle physics experiments which corrects for detector effects and provides differential cross section measurements that can be used for a number of downstream tasks, such as extracting fundamental physics parameters. Traditionally, unfolding is done by discretizing the target phase space into a finite number of bins and is limited in the number of unfolded variables. Recently, there have been a number of proposals to perform unbinned unfolding with machine learning. However, none of these methods (like most unfolding methods) allow for simultaneously constraining (profiling) nuisance parameters. We propose a new machine learning-based unfolding method that results in an unbinned differential cross section and can profile nuisance parameters. The machine learning loss function is the full likelihood function, based on binned inputs at detector-level. We first demonstrate the method with simple Gaussian examples and then show the impact on a simulated Higgs boson cross section measurement.",
