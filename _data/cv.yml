      description:
        - Developing a deep learning pipeline (using Graph Neural Network) to measure particle trajectories in High-Energy Physics detectors.
        - Developing a generative model of hadronic interactions and tune it to Geant 4 and experimental data.
        - Developing ML-based unfolding algorithms for particle physics.

    - title: Visiting Research Fellow
      institution: Machine Learning Group, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab
      year: 2022 - 2023
      description:
        - Developed novel ML applications for particle physics, including data unfolding and event simulation with generative models.
        - Translated abstract ideas into efficient and well-documented code using PyTorch, TensorFlow and Jupyter Notebook; successfully demonstrated proposed methods with practical examples.
        - Contributed to 3 projects; resulted in 2 first author journal publications (1 ongoing).

    - title: Visiting Research Fellow
      institution: ATLAS Group, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab
      year: 2021 - 2022
      description:
        - Designed experiments and conducted electrical tests on the ATLAS ITk pixel readout chips (for future upgrade).
        - Delivered promising testing results, leading to submissions of module pre-production and chip production.
        - Developed three robust 0-1 software tools using Python and C++ to automate the pixel module test procedure; successfully implemented and in use across community.

    - title: PhD researcher
      institution: CERN, Geneva, Switzerland
      year: 2018 - 2021
      description:
        - Led 4 physics analyses of the ATLAS experiment focused on Higgs physics and Dark Matter; presented 5 approval talks, resulting in 4 journal papers and 4 ATLAS conference notes. 
        - Developed ML-based event categorization and enhanced signal sensitivity by over 200%.
        - Developed statistical framework and performed statistical fitting; delivered statistical results as well as visualization plots.
        - Applied anomaly detection using unsupervised machine learning methods (e.g. VAE) and demonstrated the methods by re-discovering the Higgs boson from the ATLAS data at over 10 standard deviations.

    - title: Research Assistant
      institution: National Tsing Hua University
      year: 2015 - 2017
      description:
        - Created a Machine Learning method to improve discrimination of Higgs boson production modes.
        - Estimated Dark Matter distribution numerically in astronomical objects (Sun, supernovae and the Galaxy) and calculated impacts of Dark Matter on neutrino oscillations assuming Dark Matter-neutrino interactions; set 2 times stronger constraint on Dark Matter-neutrino coupling strength.
        - Studied 214 p-wave superconductor with the molecular beam epitaxy System (MBE).
