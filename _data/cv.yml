    - title: Machine Learning Postdoctoral Research Fellow
      institution: Lawrence Berkeley National Lab
      year: 2023-now
      description:
        - Developing a deep learning pipeline (using Graph Neural Network) to measure particle trajectories in High-Energy Physics detectors.
        - Developing a generative model of hadronic interactions and tune it to Geant 4 and experimental data.

    - title: Visiting Research Fellow
      institution: Machine Learning Group, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab
      year: 2022 - 2023
      description:
        - Developed novel ML applications for particle physics, including data unfolding and event simulation with generative models.
        - Translated abstract ideas into efficient and well-documented code using PyTorch, TensorFlow and Jupyter Notebook; successfully demonstrated proposed methods with practical examples.
        - Contributed to 3 projects; resulted in 2 first author journal publications (1 ongoing).

    - title: Visiting Research Fellow
      institution: ATLAS Group, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab
      year: 2021 - 2022
      description:
        - Designed experiments and troubleshooting to validate the ATLAS ITk pixel modules and readout chips.
        - Performed extensive electrical tests on pre-production (ITkPixV1.1) modules and chips with promising results, leading to submissions of module pre-production and chip production.
        - Developed three robust 0-1 software tools using Python and C++ to automate the pixel module QC test procedure (interacting with hardware instruments, YARR and production database); successfully implemented and in use across several leading institutions, including ANL, LBNL, and SLAC.

    - title: PhD researcher
      institution: CERN, Geneva, Switzerland
      year: 2018 - 2021
      description:
        - Led 4 physics analyses of the ATLAS experiment (Higgs to dimuon, monoHbb, Higgs combinaiton and 2HDM+a combination); presented 5 approval talks, resulting in 3 journal papers and 4 ATLAS conference notes. 
        - Developed ML-based categorization for 2 analyses (Higgs to dimuon and mono-Hbb); enhanced sensitivity by over 200% for monoHbb and 30% for Higgs to dimuon.
        - Developed statistical framework and performed statistical fitting for all 4 analyses; delivered statistical results as well as visualization plots.
        - Supporting note editor for Higgs to dimuon paper, Higgs to dimuon EPS 2019 CONF NOTE, monoHbb and 2HDM+a combination CONF NOTE.
        - Liaison between monoHbb and 2HDM+a combination team.
        - Nominated as analysis contact for 2HDM+a combination full run-2 publication.
