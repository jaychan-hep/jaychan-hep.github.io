    - title: Visiting Research Fellow
      institution: Machine Learning Group, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab
      year: 2022 - 2023
      description:
        - Developing novel ML applications for particle physics, including data unfolding and event simulation with generative models; contributed to 3 projects with 1 first author journal publication.
        - Translated abstract ideas into efficient and well-documented code using PyTorch, TensorFlow and Jupyter Notebook; successfully demonstrated proposed methods with practical examples.

   - title: Visiting Research Fellow
      institution: ATLAS Group, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab
      year: 2021 - 2022
      description:
        - Designed experiments and troubleshooting to validate the ATLAS ITk pixel modules and readout chips.
        - Performed extensive electrical tests on pre-production (ITkPixV1.1) modules and chips with promising results, leading to submissions of module pre-production and chip production.
        - Developed three robust 0-1 software tools using Python and C++ to automate the pixel module QC test procedure (interacting with hardware instruments, YARR and production database); successfully implemented and in use across several leading institutions, including ANL, LBNL, and SLAC.
